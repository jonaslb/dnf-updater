# DNF Updater Desktop Icon and Notifier
This is a simple program based on GalliumOS Update but for Fedora.
On Fedora Gnome, I've experienced that I don't get notifications about updates and the software center sucks balls anyway (not showing update progress and just being slow in general).
This program solves the issue by providing notifications and a simple icon to click that runs `dnf update` in a terminal window.

I will make it available on Copr, link coming.
